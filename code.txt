; fun fact: I'm not sure if i'm using pseudocode or actual intel syntax
; anyways, be more rigid in your specifications
; Just for now
; We assume all numbers are binary?
; 8 registers
; Address = A | B | C | D | E | F | G
; Logic = "ashl" Address |
;         "ashr" Address |
;          Address ("&" | "|" | "^" | "@") Address
; I'm not entirely sure of Arithmetic's definition here
; Arithmetic = Expression (+ | -) Expression
; Expression = Arithmetic |

; Command = Address "<-" Expression

; Registers are A-G, however move to register P to print to stdout

P <- C
D <- A & B
;C <- A @ B
;C <- A + B
